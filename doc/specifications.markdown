# Market conventions

Trading in many markets are governed by conventions. Some conventions are clearly specified in standards such as the ISDA definitions while others are not. In any case, [OpenGamma has brought together the most significant interest rate market conventions](http://developers.opengamma.com/quantitative-research/Interest-Rate-Instruments-and-Market-Conventions.pdf) together in one guide. These conventions have been largely adopted in this package with exceptions documented in the code comments.
